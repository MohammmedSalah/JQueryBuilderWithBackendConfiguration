Jquery builder with backend configuration and client library for filtration process 
using Dynamic Linq Query Builder library https://github.com/castle-it/dynamic-linq-query-builder.

the filteration config generated from backend and also can be extended to include all coonfiguration needed for jquery builder.
this query builder client library work with flat row only so if you need to filter with 
hierarchy objects or related data not direct in data entity 
the best way is creating aggregated view to contains data in flat row 
so you can use query builder client library against the view entity normally.
